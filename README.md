## Overview
    Project:       Reality:Shard 
    Info:          Aims to create a simple server-platform for online-games and the like.
    Languages:     Java
    Organization:  RealityShard

**So what is that whole thing now?**

Reality:Shard is a generic online server that is based on the design of the `javax.servlet` framework, but is not compatible with it. It was created to be a basis for mmo game-servers and their needs, yet at the same time providing the possibility to interface with other network clients, such as HTTP based ones. This project can either load deployed compiled java classes, not unlike Java's servlet containers, or can be used like a framework - most likely during the initial development phase of your product.  

 - The common interfaces can be found in the [Shardlet](https://github.com/RealityShard/Shardlet) project.
